                <article class="article-content">
                    <p>For many students at West High, the classroom had become a place of friction rather than
                        growth. Marcus, an 11th grader who once viewed school as an obstacle, found his outlook shifting
                        not in a textbook, but in the hallways of Lincoln Elementary.</p>

                    <blockquote>"I realized these kids were watching how I walked, how I talked. I couldn't just be 'the
                        kid who doesn't care' anymore. I had to be the person they think I am," Marcus shared during a
                        reflection session.</blockquote>

                    <p>Root 2 Rise pairs at-risk high schoolers with younger students, tasking them
                        with mentorship roles that demand consistency and accountability. For Elena, a senior who
                        struggled with attendance, the realization that a 3rd grader was waiting for her help with
                        reading changed everything.</p>

                    <p>By stepping into the role of the "elder," these students begin to internalize the societal rules
                        they once resisted. They aren't just following instructions; they are upholding a standard for
                        the next generation. As Jordan, another participant, puts it: "When you see a 10-year-old
                        looking up to you like you're a hero, you start wanting to actually be one."</p>
